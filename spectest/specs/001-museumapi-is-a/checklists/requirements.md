## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification successfully avoids mentioning specific technologies, programming languages, frameworks, or technical implementation approaches. All requirements are stated in terms of system capabilities and user needs.

✅ **Focused on user value**: The specification centers on visitor needs (finding hours, discovering events, purchasing tickets) and business needs (event management, revenue generation) without diving into technical solutions.

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: Language is clear and accessible. Terms like "system," "visitor," and "administrator" are used instead of technical jargon. Business concepts are explained in plain language.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: The specification includes all required sections:
- User Scenarios & Testing (with 5 prioritized user stories)
- Requirements (with 23 functional requirements organized by category)
- Success Criteria (with 8 measurable outcomes)
- Additional sections: Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**: The specification contains zero clarification markers. All requirements are stated definitively with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each functional requirement uses clear, actionable language (MUST statements) with specific capabilities defined. For example:
- FR-001: "System MUST provide current and future museum operating hours including opening time, closing time, and date"
- FR-020: "System MUST validate that special event prices are positive values"

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All 8 success criteria include specific, quantifiable metrics:
- SC-001: "under 2 seconds"
- SC-003: "under 60 seconds"
- SC-004: "99.9% of the time"
- SC-007: "95% of visitors"
- SC-008: "at least 100 concurrent transactions"

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes and business metrics without mentioning implementation technologies. Examples:
- "Visitors can retrieve museum hours" (not "API returns JSON response")
- "System accurately processes ticket purchases" (not "Database transaction commits successfully")

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each of the 5 user stories includes multiple Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios (13 scenarios total) that clearly define expected behavior.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: The specification includes 6 specific edge cases covering boundary conditions, error scenarios, and concurrent operations:
- Future dates without scheduled hours
- Tickets for closed dates
- Deleting events with sold tickets
- Capacity limits and concurrent purchases
- Price updates after sales
- Invalid event dates for purchases

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: The "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 10 features that will NOT be included:
- Physical ticket printing/QR codes
- Customer account management
- Refund processing
- Email notifications
- Membership programs
- Gift shop sales
- Event capacity management
- Multi-language support
- Mobile applications
- Marketing features

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: 
- Assumptions section lists 6 key assumptions about data sources, payment processing, authentication, and system usage
- Dependencies section identifies 4 external dependencies including scheduling systems, payment services, authentication systems, and organizational policies

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: The 23 functional requirements are written as testable MUST statements with specific capabilities. User stories provide acceptance scenarios that map to these requirements.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 5 prioritized user stories cover all major feature areas:
- P1: Query museum hours (information retrieval)
- P1: Browse special events (discovery and planning)
- P2: Purchase museum tickets (transaction processing)
- P2: Purchase special event tickets (specialized transactions)
- P3: Manage special events (administrative functions)

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Success criteria align with user stories and functional requirements, providing clear targets for:
- Performance (response times, throughput)
- Reliability (error rates, data validation)
- Usability (task completion rates)
- Scalability (concurrent user support)

✅ **No implementation details leak**: The specification maintains strict separation between WHAT (requirements) and HOW (implementation). No references to specific technologies, APIs, database schemas, or code structures appear in the specification.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete, high-quality, and ready to proceed to the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). All checklist items pass validation:

- Content is business-focused and accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- Success criteria provide measurable targets for validation
- Scope, dependencies, and assumptions are well-documented
- No technical implementation details constrain the solution design

The specification provides a solid foundation for technical planning and implementation without prematurely committing to specific technologies or approaches.
