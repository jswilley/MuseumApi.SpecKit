***

### üìù Overview

| Attribute | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Feature ID** | FR-006 |
| **Feature Name** | Delete Special Event |
| **Type** | API Endpoint (DELETE) |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Tags** | `Events` |
| **Related Path** | `/SpecialEvent/{EventId}` |

***

### üéØ Goal (User Story)

As a **Museum Administrator**,
I want to **permanently delete a cancelled or invalid special event** from the system,
So that **visitors are no longer able to view or book it**.

***

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specification

#### **Endpoint Definition**

* **Method:** `DELETE`
* **Path:** `/SpecialEvent/{EventId}`
* **`operationId`:** `deleteSpecialEvent`

#### **Parameters (Path)**

| Name | Type | Required | Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EventId` | **integer** (or **string**) | **Yes** | Path | The unique system identifier for the event to be deleted. |

*Note: The specification lists `EventId` type as **date**, which is highly unusual for an identifier. Assuming it should be an **integer** or **string** based on common API practices for IDs.*

#### **Request/Response Body**

* **Request Body:** **None** (The identifier is in the path).
* **Successful Response Body:** **None** (Standard practice for HTTP **204 No Content**).

***

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (AC) and Test Cases

#### **AC 1: Successful Event Deletion**

* **Criterion:** A successful DELETE request for an existing special event must return an **HTTP 204 No Content** response.
* **Test Case 1.1 (Valid Deletion):**
    * **Pre-condition:** Event with ID `202` exists in the system.
    * **Input:** `DELETE /SpecialEvent/202`
    * **Expected Output:** **HTTP 204 No Content**. A subsequent GET request for `/SpecialEvent/202` should return a **404 Not Found**.

#### **AC 2: Failure on Bad Request/Unauthorized**

* **Criterion:** If the DELETE fails due to an invalid request or authorization issue, the API must return an appropriate error response (**400 Bad Request** or **401 Unauthorized**).
* **Test Case 2.1 (Invalid Parameter Format):**
    * **Input:** `DELETE /SpecialEvent/INVALID_ID_FORMAT`
    * **Expected Output:** **HTTP 400 Bad Request** with a structured error model indicating a path parameter format error.
* **Test Case 2.2 (Authorization Failure):**
    * **Pre-condition:** The user sends the request without required authorization credentials.
    * **Input:** `DELETE /SpecialEvent/202`
    * **Expected Output:** **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** (as defined in the response codes).

#### **AC 3: Event Not Found**

* **Criterion:** If the requested `EventId` does not correspond to an existing special event, the API must return an **HTTP 404 Not Found** response.
* **Test Case 3.1 (Non-existent ID):**
    * **Input:** `DELETE /SpecialEvent/88888` (assuming this ID is not in the system)
    * **Expected Output:** **HTTP 404 Not Found** with a structured error model indicating the resource was not found.
