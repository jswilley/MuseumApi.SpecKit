# Implementation Plan: Museum API

**Branch**: `001-museumapi-is-a` | **Date**: October 21, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-museumapi-is-a/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The Museum API provides a RESTful web service enabling visitors to query museum operating hours and special events, purchase tickets for general admission and special events, and allows administrators to manage the special events catalog. The system will be built as a stateless API service with persistent data storage, focusing on simplicity, testability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# 12 / .NET 9.0  
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core (Minimal APIs), Entity Framework Core, Swashbuckle (OpenAPI)  
**Storage**: SQLite (development/testing), configurable for production (SQL Server/PostgreSQL)  
**Testing**: xUnit, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing, EF Core SQLite provider, Moq
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux/Windows/macOS), containerizable  
**Project Type**: Single web API project  
**Performance Goals**: <2 seconds for queries, <60 seconds for ticket purchases, 100+ concurrent requests  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 for read operations, ACID compliance for ticket purchases, role-based access control for admin operations  
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ daily visitors, hundreds of special events annually, 25+ concurrent transactions
**Observability** OpenTelemetry and Serilog

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Source**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Plan fully complies with constitutional requirements

### Core Principles Compliance

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Architectural Consistency** | ✅ PASS | Plan aligns with C# Minimal API, SQLite, .NET 9+ stack |
| **Test-First Development** | ✅ PASS | xUnit testing with 70%+ coverage target, integration tests prioritized |
| **RESTful Design** | ✅ PASS | All endpoints follow REST principles, proper HTTP verbs |
| **Maintainability** | ✅ PASS | 70%+ code coverage planned, comprehensive test strategy |

### Architectural Constraints Compliance

| Constraint Category | Status | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------|----------------|
| **API Governance** | ✅ PASS | OpenAPI contract defined, standard HTTP status codes, consistent error handling planned |
| **Opinionated Stack** | ✅ PASS | C# 12/.NET 9, SQLite, Minimal APIs, DI mandatory |
| **Code Standards** | ✅ PASS | Business logic in injectable services, no inline logic in endpoints, endpoint groups planned |
| **Performance** | ✅ PASS | All I/O operations async/await throughout |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ PASS | Centralized exception handling with Serilog planned |
| **Authentication/Authorization** | ✅ PASS | Role-based authorization for admin endpoints |
| **Versioning** | ⚠️ DEFERRED | URI path versioning with Asp.Versioning.Http - to be added in future iteration |

### Quality Gates Compliance

| Gate | Status | Implementation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Integration Tests** | ✅ PASS | WebApplicationFactory with in-memory test server planned |
| **70% Coverage Minimum** | ✅ PASS | Integration + unit test strategy targets >70% coverage |
| **Living Documentation** | ✅ PASS | spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/ all generated and synchronized |

### Decision Making Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Developer Authority** | ✅ PASS | All decisions documented in plan.md with rationale in research.md |
| **Incremental Changes** | ✅ PASS | Building new API, not modifying existing foundation |
| **Backward Compatibility** | N/A | New project - no legacy code to maintain compatibility with |

### Notes

- All constitutional requirements are met or explicitly planned in the implementation strategy
- Test-first approach with integration tests as priority aligns with Quality Gates
- RESTful design, DI, and separation of concerns are foundational to the plan

**Structure Decision**: Single ASP.NET Core Web API project following Minimal API pattern. This structure provides:
- Clear separation between data models (Models/), API contracts (DTOs/), and endpoints (Endpoints/)
- Entity Framework Core for data access with explicit DbContext
- Services to Wrap calls to EntityFrameWork Core context calls.  Interfaces injected into endpoints
- Endpoint-based organization for scalability (easy to add new endpoint groups)
- Comprehensive test coverage with both integration and unit tests. Use file-based SQLite database for tests
