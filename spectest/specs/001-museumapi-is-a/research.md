**Feature**: Museum API  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This document captures technical research, architecture decisions, and rationale for technology choices made during the planning phase of the Museum API project.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision 1: C# / .NET 8.0

**Decision**: Use C# 12 with .NET 8.0 as the primary development platform

**Rationale**:
- Mature, production-ready framework with excellent performance characteristics
- Native support for RESTful API development through ASP.NET Core
- Cross-platform runtime (Linux, Windows, macOS) enables flexible deployment
- Strong typing system reduces runtime errors and improves maintainability
- Excellent tooling support (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)
- Built-in dependency injection and configuration management
- Long-term support (LTS) release with security updates through November 2026

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Python (FastAPI)**: Rejected - While excellent for rapid prototyping, .NET provides better performance for high-concurrency scenarios and stronger type safety
- **Node.js (Express)**: Rejected - JavaScript's dynamic typing would increase bug risk for financial transactions (ticket purchases)
- **Java (Spring Boot)**: Rejected - More verbose than C#, heavier runtime footprint, no significant advantages for this use case
- **Go**: Rejected - Less mature ORM ecosystem, team expertise is stronger in .NET

### Decision 2: ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs

**Decision**: Use Minimal API pattern instead of traditional MVC controllers

**Rationale**:
- Reduced boilerplate code - endpoints defined directly without controller classes
- Better performance due to reduced abstraction layers
- Simpler project structure for API-only applications
- Native OpenAPI/Swagger support with minimal configuration
- Easier to understand and maintain for API-focused applications
- Aligns with modern microservice patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **MVC Controllers**: Rejected - Unnecessary complexity for a pure API service, no views or model binding benefits needed
- **gRPC**: Rejected - Overkill for this use case, REST is more accessible for potential client applications
- **GraphQL**: Rejected - Query flexibility not required, REST patterns are sufficient for well-defined operations

### Decision 3: Entity Framework Core

**Decision**: Use Entity Framework Core as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)

**Rationale**:
- First-party Microsoft ORM with excellent .NET integration
- Code-first approach enables version-controlled database schema
- Migration system simplifies database versioning and deployment
- LINQ queries provide type-safe, compile-time checked database operations
- Built-in change tracking simplifies CRUD operations
- Support for multiple database providers (SQLite, SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
- Excellent testing support with InMemory provider

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Dapper (micro-ORM)**: Rejected - Would require writing more SQL manually, losing type safety benefits
- **Raw ADO.NET**: Rejected - Too low-level, increases boilerplate and maintenance burden
- **NHibernate**: Rejected - More complex configuration, EF Core is more idiomatic for modern .NET

### Decision 4: SQLite (Development) / Configurable Production Database

**Decision**: Use SQLite for development and testing, support SQL Server/PostgreSQL for production

**Rationale**:
- SQLite requires zero configuration for local development
- File-based database simplifies development environment setup
- Perfect for integration testing (fast, isolated, disposable)
- EF Core provider parity allows seamless database switching
- Production flexibility - can deploy to SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL without code changes
- Reduces friction for new developers joining the project

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **SQL Server only**: Rejected - Requires SQL Server installation for development, creates environment setup friction
- **PostgreSQL only**: Rejected - Same setup friction as SQL Server
- **InMemory provider only**: Rejected - Doesn't support all SQL features (e.g., unique constraints), insufficient for thorough testing

### Decision 5: xUnit Testing Framework

**Decision**: Use xUnit with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing for integration tests

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard testing framework for .NET
- Clean, attribute-based test definition
- Excellent parallel test execution support
- Test isolation through constructor/dispose pattern
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing provides WebApplicationFactory for full API testing
- InMemory database provider enables fast, isolated integration tests
- Strong community support and documentation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **NUnit**: Rejected - Less idiomatic for modern .NET Core, xUnit has better async support
- **MSTest**: Rejected - Fewer features than xUnit, less popular in community
- **BDD frameworks (SpecFlow)**: Rejected - Unnecessary complexity for API testing

## Architecture Patterns

### Decision 6: Direct DbContext Usage (No Repository Pattern)

**Decision**: Endpoints directly inject and use DbContext, no repository abstraction layer

**Rationale**:
- DbContext already implements Unit of Work and Repository patterns
- Additional repository layer adds no value in this simple API
- Follows YAGNI principle - only add abstractions when needed
- Reduces indirection and makes code easier to understand
- EF Core provides sufficient testability through InMemory provider
- Can refactor to repository pattern later if complexity demands it

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Generic Repository Pattern**: Rejected - Adds boilerplate without benefits for this straightforward CRUD API
- **CQRS Pattern**: Rejected - Overkill for this use case, no complex query requirements
- **Specification Pattern**: Rejected - Unnecessary abstraction for simple queries

### Decision 7: DTO Pattern for API Contracts

**Decision**: Separate DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) from entity models

**Rationale**:
- Decouples API contract from database schema
- Prevents accidental exposure of internal implementation details
- Allows API shape to evolve independently of data model
- Enables different representations (e.g., including/excluding related data)
- Supports versioning strategies
- Clear separation of concerns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Direct entity exposure**: Rejected - Creates tight coupling between API and database, risks breaking changes
- **Projections only**: Rejected - Less explicit contract definition, harder to maintain API compatibility

### Decision 8: Endpoint Organization

**Decision**: Group endpoints by resource type (MuseumHours, SpecialEvents, TicketPurchase)

**Rationale**:
- Clear organization by domain concept
- Easy to locate related operations
- Supports future modularization (e.g., separate microservices)
- Aligns with REST resource modeling
- Scales better than monolithic Program.cs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **All endpoints in Program.cs**: Rejected - Becomes unwieldy as API grows
- **Feature folders**: Rejected - More complex structure than needed for this API

## Security & Authorization

### Decision 9: Role-Based Authorization for Admin Operations

**Decision**: Use ASP.NET Core [Authorize] attribute with role claims for admin endpoints

**Rationale**:
- Built-in framework support for authorization
- Simple role-based model fits requirements (admin vs. public)
- Can integrate with existing authentication systems (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
- Declarative authorization keeps endpoint code clean
- Easy to test with TestServer and authentication mocking

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Custom authorization logic**: Rejected - Reinvents the wheel, less secure
- **Policy-based authorization**: Rejected - Overkill for simple admin/public distinction

## API Design Principles

### Decision 10: RESTful Resource Design

**Decision**: Follow REST conventions for resource naming and HTTP verbs

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard, well-understood by developers
- Clear semantics (GET = read, POST = create, PUT = update, DELETE = delete)
- Stateless design improves scalability
- Cache-friendly for read operations
- Native HTTP status code support for error handling

**Endpoints Structure**:
- `GET /museumhours` - Retrieve hours (with optional date filters)
- `GET /specialevents` - List all events
- `GET /specialevents/{id}` - Get specific event
- `POST /specialevents` - Create event (admin)
- `PUT /specialevents/{id}` - Update event (admin)
- `DELETE /specialevents/{id}` - Delete event (admin)
- `POST /tickets/purchase` - Purchase tickets

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **RPC-style endpoints** (e.g., /purchaseTicket): Rejected - Less idiomatic, harder to understand
- **GraphQL**: Rejected - Unnecessary complexity for well-defined operations
- **SOAP**: Rejected - Legacy protocol, XML overhead

## Data Validation Strategy

### Decision 11: Data Annotations + FluentValidation

**Decision**: Use data annotations for simple validations, consider FluentValidation for complex rules

**Rationale**:
- Data annotations provide declarative, self-documenting constraints
- Automatic model validation in ASP.NET Core
- Clear violation messages for API consumers
- FluentValidation available if complex validation rules emerge
- Testable validation logic

**Validation Rules**:
- Required fields (event name, dates, prices)
- Positive price values (FR-020)
- Valid date formats (FR-021)
- Unique constraints via database indexes (FR-022, FR-023)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Custom validation only**: Rejected - Requires more code, less standardized
- **No validation**: Rejected - Violates functional requirements

## Performance Considerations

### Decision 12: Eager Loading for Related Data

**Decision**: Use `.Include()` to eager load related entities when needed

**Rationale**:
- Prevents N+1 query problems
- Single database roundtrip for parent + children
- Performance critical for special events with dates
- EF Core change tracking benefits

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Lazy loading**: Rejected - Can cause unexpected database calls, performance issues
- **Manual joins**: Rejected - EF Core handles this better

### Decision 13: Async/Await Throughout

**Decision**: All database operations and endpoint handlers use async/await

**Rationale**:
- Non-blocking I/O improves throughput under load
- Essential for meeting 100+ concurrent request goal
- ASP.NET Core optimized for async pipeline
- EF Core operations are naturally async
- Standard practice for web APIs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Synchronous operations**: Rejected - Would limit scalability and throughput

## Testing Strategy

### Decision 14: Integration Tests with WebApplicationFactory

**Decision**: Primary test strategy is integration testing using in-memory test server

**Rationale**:
- Tests entire request/response pipeline
- Validates routing, model binding, serialization
- Uses real EF Core with InMemory database
- Catches integration issues between layers
- High confidence in deployed behavior

**Test Scope**:
- All HTTP endpoints
- Request/response serialization
- Validation rules
- Database constraints
- Error responses

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Unit tests only**: Rejected - Miss integration issues between components
- **Manual testing only**: Rejected - Not repeatable, doesn't catch regressions

### Decision 15: SQLite for Unit/Integration Tests

**Decision**: Use SQLite (file or in-memory) for database-dependent tests

**Rationale**:
- Supports full SQL feature set (unlike InMemory provider)
- Tests unique constraints, foreign keys, and indexes
- Fast test execution
- No external database dependencies
- Disposable per-test databases

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **InMemory provider only**: Rejected - Doesn't enforce constraints properly
- **Test containers**: Rejected - Slower, adds Docker dependency for CI/CD

## Deployment & Operations

### Decision 16: Container-Ready Application

**Decision**: Structure application for containerization (Docker)

**Rationale**:
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Easy to scale horizontally
- Simplified dependency management
- Cloud-native deployment options (Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps)
- Isolation from host system

**Configuration**:
- Environment-based configuration (appsettings.json per environment)
- Connection strings from environment variables
- Health check endpoints for orchestration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **IIS deployment only**: Rejected - Less portable, Windows-only
- **Serverless functions**: Rejected - Overkill for stateful API with database

## Open Questions & Future Considerations
