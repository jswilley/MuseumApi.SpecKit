# Implementation Tasks: Museum API

**Branch**: `001-museumapi-is-a` | **Generated**: October 22, 2025  
**Architecture**: ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs with Service Layer, .NET 9.0, SQLite, API Versioning, Security Policies

## Task Breakdown Strategy

This implementation follows a **test-driven development (TDD)** approach with **layered architecture**:
1. **Services layer** wraps Entity Framework Core context calls with interfaces
2. **Security layer** implements policy-based authorization
3. **API Versioning** for future-proof endpoint management
4. **File-based SQLite** for both development and testing (not in-memory)
5. Each phase delivers **independently testable user value**

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks align with architectural principles - test-first, REST, maintainability, DI
