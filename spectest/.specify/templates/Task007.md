* **Criterion:** If the request lacks a valid authentication token, the API must return an **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** response.
* **Test Case 2.1 (Missing Token):**
    * **Input:** A valid JSON object matching the `SpecialEvent` schema with all required fields. without an `Authorization` header.
    * **Expected Output:** **HTTP 401 Unauthorized**.
