## Museum API Fork Specification

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Specification Version** | 1.0 |
| **Project Name** | Museum API Fork |
| **Feature Name** | Museum API recreation in spec-kit |

-----

### Overview

  * **Summary:** This takes **Museum API** (OpenAPI 3.1.0) and converts it to spec-kit specifications. In the plans, I will get into how I want the data generated.
  * **Motivation:** To see if I can get **spec-kit** to generate my OpenAPI for me.

### Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Query Operating Hours** | User can query the hours that the Museum is open. |
| **Query Special Events** | User can query the details for a special event. |
| **Manage Special Events** | Administrators can manage special events (Create, Update, Delete). |
| **Buy Tickets** | User can buy tickets for special events or general access to the museum. |

### User Scenarios

| Scenario | User Story |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operating Hours** | As a user, I want to retrieve a paginated list of hours for a particular date range. Each day will also have a link to the SpecialEvents showing on that day. |
| **Special Event Detail Retrieval** | As a museum client, I want to retrieve the complete details of a single **SpecialEvent** using its unique identifier so that I can link deep-dive content about that specific item. This can be obtained from the operating hours list. |
| **Special Event Creation** | As a museum administrator, I want to create a single **SpecialEvent**. |
| **Special Event Update** | As a museum administrator, I want to update a single **SpecialEvent**. |
| **Special Event Deletion** | As a museum administrator, I want to delete a single **SpecialEvent**. |
| **Buy Museum Tickets** | As a museum client, I want to buy tickets for either general entry or a special event. |

    2.  **FR-001 AC 2:** If the `'PaginationPage=true'` query filter is used, only SpecialEvents an array for that page based on `PageLimitCount`.
  * **Response Codes:** Defines successful responses (200) and error responses (400, 404) with structured error models.
